<h2>Lesson  2 - Variables & Fields</h2>

<div id="cont">

<p>Once you have written down the code for the contact us page, from the previous page, we can now<br>
begin the PHP scripting. This will be done in the same contact us file, which will be written above the<br>
Document Type Declaration. Type in an open and closed PHP tags like below.<br></p>

<p>Now we will start with the first section of the PHP script. This is setting up our variables and<br>
referencing the input field names of the contact us page. Read the description of the code<br>
and type in the code following it. This will be the structure of the tutorial.<br></p>

<p>The <strong>$isSent</strong> variable will be the indicator whether the content of the web<br>
form has been sent. It is set to false to signify that no form has been sent with the email address.<br></p>

<p>The <strong>$hasError</strong> variable is used to print an error message if there are any errors in<br>
the input fields. It is set to false by default to signify there are currently no errors, when it’s true an<br>
error message will be written above the form in red. The error message will be discussed in later on<br>
in the tutorial.<br></p>

<p>The <strong>$isURLAllowed</strong> checks that the URL supplied with the email is permitted. This<br>
check prevents spam from coming through your inbox. You can set it to true if you want to allow URL<br>
to be supplied to the form.<br></p>

<p>The <strong>$fields</strong> variable is important part of this section of code. This variable<br>
compiles an array of the input fields names used in the contact us page. The input field name comes<br>
from the “name” name of the input field. So for example the Email Address input field name has an “name”<br>
name called <strong>email</strong>, so the name <strong>email</strong> will be referenced in the<br>
list of arrays. So when the input fields have been referenced they will be stored in the<br>
<strong>$fields</strong> variable. This will be used later in the script for printing out the content<br>
entered in the input fields.<br></p>

<p>Before we continue writing the next section of the PHP script, make sure the pieces of code typed<br>
above come together like this:<br></p>
