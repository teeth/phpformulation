<h2>Lesson 1 - Create Web Form</h2>

<div id="cont">

We will start of by creating a simple web Form, which will be used to base our PHP script on.<br>
Readers of this tutorial might already have a website with a web form and are looking to apply the<br>
PHP script to their page, but for the benefit of the readers who haven’t created a web form already,<br>
we will start this tutorial with a design of a simple web form. Also a note, none of the codes in this<br>
tutorial will be available for download; the codes have to be copied line by line. This is beneficial for<br>
readers to learn the process of building the code step by step. If the code was just offered for<br>
download, people probably won’t learn much.<br>

<p>Below is a screen shot a Web Form which will be utilised as a contact us page. It contains seven input<br>
fields to it, which are important elements when we go on to the PHP scripting.<br></p><p>

<img src="images/contactus.png" /><br><br>

The screenshot shows a web form that contains input fields which includes text fields, a drop down<br>
list and a radio button. Plus two buttons: the reset button to empty the fields and a submit button to<br>
submit the form. The text fields consists of fields where the user can enter their <strong>Name</strong>, the<br>
<strong>Organisation</strong> they represent, their <strong>Email Address</strong>, <strong>Telephone Number</strong> and a large space where they<br>
can type in their concerning <strong>Message</strong>. As well as the text fields, there’s the drop down list for users<br>
to select a <strong>Subject</strong> for their message and a radio button to <strong>Rate the Website</strong> they visited.<br>

<p>If you noticed the words that are bold, they are the seven input fields which are going to be<br>
referenced in the PHP. These will be the information that will be sent to your email account.<br><p>

<p>Below is the HTML code to the web form displayed above. Copy this code because it will be used as<br>
part of the PHP script we’re going to create. Here is a download of the CSS file, to get the same look<br>
as the Web Form displayed above. <a href="style.css" target="_blank">Download</a>.<br><p>

Save the file as a HTML file and open it to see it looks as exactly the screenshot above.<br>
