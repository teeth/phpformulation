<h2>F.A.Q.</h2>

<div id="cont">

<strong>Should i choose a specific area of PHP like string handling or a bit higher like; tools to improve your website/server or would a more general tutorial be better?</strong><br>

Up to you - personally I think a more focused tutorial would be easier and more rewarding, but each to their own!<br><br>

<strong>Does it matter that there are so many (good) tutorials out there (and just about anything)?</strong><br>

No- in the first place few are aimed at web masters (potentially a significant difference when compared with a more generic tutorial) and in the second it is your synthesis and approach that is going to make it unique. It's nice that there are some good examples to help you reflect on what it is that is so good about them.<br>
It wouldn't be an issue for most coursework that people are doing much the same sort of thing as everyone else after all!<br><br>

<strong>I want to write about JSP|PHP|Perl|.net|etc. Is that too much aimed at developers?</strong><br>

Only if you make it so. You shouldn't be afraid to talk about coding if that is what you are more interested in doing, as a webmaster would certainly benefit from at least knowing how to interpret code that is put on the server. For instance, this would help him/her to identify where issues may arise (e.g. security, performance, faults, accounting etc) as a result of problems in the code. It might also be appropriate knowledge for site management - for instance, the ability to understand the code behind a CMS is pretty vital, especially when setting something up in the first place. On the human front it is also helpful to be able to talk with developers at an appropriate level, which implies understanding their concerns and constraints. A webmaster might also be called upon to discuss relative merits of technologies with the board - again, understanding the technologies in detail would be essential, but with a very different emphasis.
Many other possibilities. The central point is that, when constructing your tutorial, you should have a clear idea in mind of the kind of learning outcome(s) you are looking for and how they match to a webmaster's needs.
