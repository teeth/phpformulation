<h2>Lesson 3 - Headers</h2>

<div id="cont">
In this section of the script we’ll be working with the <strong>$header</strong> variable.<br>
“<italic>When your browser requests a web page from a server via HTTP, it sends a set of headers<br>
with various bits of information about itself.</italic>” This quote applies when you receive an email<br>
in your inbox from the web form.<br>

<p>We will use an if-statement to check that the user has entered an email address in the<br>
<strong>email</strong> field and the submit button has been pressed. If we don’t check that the<br>
submit has been checked, you will constantly get emails full of blank fields, every time someone<br>
goes on the page.<br></p>

<p>The header variable below uses a <strong>MIME-Version</strong> declaration. This is used to<br>
declare the version of the Internet message body format standard that is being used. The version<br>
that is usually used is "1.0". The <strong>\r\n</strong> means a new line.<br></p>

<p>The next header variable helps identify the type of information that a file contains. It tells us the<br>
type of content that will be sent to the email. This is a <strong>text/html</strong> format. If we<br>
didn’t specify the <strong>Content-type</strong>, when the email is sent, the variables called to<br>
display in the email will be displayed in plain text, showing all the html tags. So the <strong>Content-<br>
type</strong> is used to render content sent to our inbox in HTML.<br></p>

<p>The last header field retrieves the email address of the user that sent the form. The<br>
<strong>email</strong> field is referenced here because that’s the input field where the user enters<br>
their email address. So the email address entered is who it’s <strong>From</strong>.<br></p>

<p>Before continuing to the next section of the PHP script, make sure the lines of code have been<br>
written and looks like this:<br></p>
